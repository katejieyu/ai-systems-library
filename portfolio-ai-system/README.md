# Portfolio AI System

A portfolio strategy, audit, and rewrite system for job applications at Staff / Principal level.

Evaluates portfolios as products competing for hiring decisions. Runs a 7-step workflow: intent definition, issue diagnosis, goal alignment, hiring simulation, UX/QA check, rewrite, and execution plan.
